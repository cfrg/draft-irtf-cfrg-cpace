For generating test vectors with sage use

make clean
make 
make testvectors

There will be a json file and a markdown file generated and stored at ../

Don't forget to also pull the submodules: We include code from the hash_to_curve reference implementation.


Warning:
The jupyter notebook files might be a bit outdated. Recently we only worked on the plain .sage scripts.
