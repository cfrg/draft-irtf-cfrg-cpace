## Generating test vectors

The markdown code for the test-vector appendices should not be modified by hand-editing as it is
automatically generated by the sagemath scripts in the poc subdirectory. Modifications in the
test vector text should be realized by modifying the corresponding scripts.

## Command Line Usage

Formatted text and HTML versions of the draft can be built using `make`.

```sh
$ make
```

Command line usage requires that you have the necessary software installed.  See
[the instructions](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/main/doc/SETUP.md).
